                The song "We Don't Talk Anymore" by Charlie Puth, featuring Selena Gomez, tells the story of a relationship that has faded and communication has ceased. The singers reminisce about the past, but acknowledge that time has moved on and they've gone their separate ways. Despite the sadness of the situation, they find acceptance in the fact that things change and move forward.<br><br>
                
                The song's catchy melody and melancholic lyrics resonated with many listeners, making it a major commercial success.
